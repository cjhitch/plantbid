the app folder is Next's version of routes or pages - this must be used for top level routing

The name of the folder is the route that will be hit - this must match our routing path
ie. Products folder name must be /products for the route to be lowercase and not upper

One of the biggest differences for 'pages' or routes for nextjs is they will require a page.ts file instead of an index.ts file
